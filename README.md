## Digit Recognition Program


## Overview

In this project, the goal is to write a software pipeline to identify a sequence of digits in an image.

The suggested steps of this project were the following:

* Create a synthetic dataset based on MNIST characters.
* Propose a network to solve the problem on the synthetic dataset.
* Discuss the training method.
* Test the model on a realistic dataset, the SVHN dataset was recommended for this step, and discuss the results.
* Propose changes to the existing model and analyze the new results.
* Test on images that we capture and discuss the results.
* Train a number localizer and discuss the results.
* Test on the same user-captured images
